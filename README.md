# Journal Server - Rust
This is an implementation of a server that can be used to maintain a journal. The journal takes a _phrase_ and appropriately organizes it into files for each day a journal entry is made. For a day with multiple entries, the journal appends the phrase to that day's journal with a timestamp.
